# Objective

Demonstrate application deployment for Linux systems.  This demonstration will install applications on multiple RHEL servers.

# What business problem is solved?

- **speed to market**:
reducing human time to install applications
- **reduce human error**:
automation of routine manual processes
- **reduce complexity**:
does not require a System Administrator familiar with the specific operating system to install the Application.  Automate and test once and allow all users access to deploy Ansible Jobs.

Ansible creates guard rails on which applications can be deployed and how they are installed on IT infrastructure.
