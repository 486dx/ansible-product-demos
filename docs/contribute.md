# Contribute

This project is **not** currently taking PRs (pull requests) or code contributions.  This is currently a work in progress and not at a point that would make sense to take contributions.  Please try to make PRs into [ansible-examples](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples) if you want to showcase Ansible Playbooks or roles.
